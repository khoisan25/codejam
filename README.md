# Solutions to Code Jam problems

This repository is basically my solution dump for the Google Codejam competition. It includes both official submissions made and solutions curated as an afterthought. While a majority of the solutions are written in python, I have included a couple written in Bash depending on the complexity of the problem.

## Format

Each solution is contained in a folder with the following structure:

```
<year>/<round>/<problem>/<solution>.<ext>
```

For example, the solution to the [d1000000](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1/0000000000a46471) problem of the qualification round of the 2022 competition in Bash is located at:

```
2022/Qualification/d1000000/solution.sh
```

## Usage

The solutions are written in a variety of languages, so you'll need to have the appropriate interpreter/compiler installed to run them.

For example, to run the solution to the [d1000000](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000876ff1/0000000000a46471) problem of the qualification round of the 2022 competition in Bash, you can run:

```
bash 2022/Qualification/d1000000/solution.sh < in > out
```
